			<p>Do you frequently open Grooveshark/Pandora/iTunes/etc and just stare at it while trying to decide what to listen next?

			<p>I do it all the time. I probably visit my own last.fm profile a dozen times a week, just so I can take a look at my library and pick a familiar name to put into the search field (yeah, <strong>I dumped Last.FM radio for Grooveshark</strong> - I like to hear whole albums).

			<p>Enter <a href="#">What should I listen to?</a>, the dumbest web service ever. It takes a last.fm username and a click, and gives back lots of love in the form of good music recommendations (actually these recommendations come from yourself, but you gotta give it some credit...)
				I had a lot of fun building it: 
				<ul>
					<li>runs on node.js, courtesy of nodester
					<li>IDs are saved in localStorage, and your library's size in your cookies (we need to know the range to shoot at), so no database.
					<li>It has no images per se, the noisy background is generated via Javascript CoffeeScript and the rest is CSS.
					<li>It's not mobile-ready, though that should be easy to accomplish. Source code is on github.
				</ul>
			<p>I hope it's useful for a few people out there. If you have any suggestions you can find me on Twitter.
